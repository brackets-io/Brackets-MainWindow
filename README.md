Brackets MainWindow
===================

Do you work with multiple Brackets windows open simultaneously?
Have you ever closed the main application window without knowing it, and sat ... hating yourself ... powerless ... watching how all your windows and Brackets closed before you?
With Brackets MainWindow, you are always aware of which is the main window!
Never again will you close a random window, hoping you didn't close the main window!

FAQ
===================

* The notification does not appear?
  - If you are on Mac, then only the indicator is displayed in the status bar. The reason is that closing the main window on mac does not close the application as on Windows.
  - Did you turn it off? Go to the toolbar of the main window and click on the MainWindow icon. If it turns orange it means it is now enabled!
