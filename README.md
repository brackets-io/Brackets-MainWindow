Brackets MainWindow
===================

Do you work with multiple Brackets windows open simultaneously?
Have you ever closed the main application window without knowing it, and sat ... hating yourself ... powerless ... watching how all your windows and Brackets closed before you?
With Brackets MainWindow, you are always aware of which is the main window!
Never again will you close a random window, hoping you didn't close the main window!
